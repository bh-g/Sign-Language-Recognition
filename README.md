# Real-Time Sign Language to Speech Conversion on Edge Devices: A Jetson Nano Implementation 

This project is a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling recognition system. It focuses on recognizing alphabet gestures using deep learning techniques like spatio-temporal feature extraction and attention mechanisms.

Built with a custom dataset of 24 alphabet classes and a blank class, the model leverages MobileNetV2 for efficient feature extraction and real-time predictions.

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # for Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # for Windows
```

### 3. Install the required dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the project

```bash
application.py
```

### 1. Jetson Nano Board

* Use a Jetson Nano Developer Kit.

* Insert a microSD card (at least 32GB, Class 10/UHS-1) flashed with JetPack (Jetson's Ubuntu-based OS).

### 2. Power Supply

* Recommended: 5V 4A DC Barrel Jack power supply.

* Alternate: 5V 2.5A micro-USB (only for lightweight tasks).

  `Important: Insufficient power may cause random reboots or throttling!`

### 3. Peripherals

* Keyboard and Mouse via USB.

* Monitor connected through HDMI or DisplayPort.

* Internet Connection:

  * Wired Ethernet is preferred (faster and more stable).

  * USB Wi-Fi adapter (make sure itâ€™s compatible with Ubuntu 18.04/20.04).

* Audio Output (Speakers): USB Speakers (plug into USB port).

* Camera: USB Webcam (plug into USB port).
